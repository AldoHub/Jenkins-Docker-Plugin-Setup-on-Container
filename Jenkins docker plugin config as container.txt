Steps to configure Jenkins Docker plugin when running jenkins as container


1- Install Docker Plugin on Jenkins
2- Go to Manage Jenkins -> System Configuration -> Scroll down to bottom -> Add Cloud -> Docker
3- If you are running docker as container, in the docker host uri you have to enter unix or tcp address of the docker host.
   But since you are running jenkins as container, the container cant reach docker host unix port
4- So we have to run another container that can mediate between docker host and jenkins container.
   It will publish docker hosts unix port as tcp port. Follow the instructions to create a socat container
   https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/socat/ 

---use the next command to configure the socat (follow the command on https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/socat/ - "Expose a tcp socket for accessing docker" )
   
   docker run -d --restart=always -p 127.0.0.1:2376:2375 --network jenkins -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock alpine/socat tcp-listen:2375,fork,reuseaddr unix-connect:/var/run/docker.sock

---That should create the proxy from jenkins master to local machine
---Now get the ip from the socat server using (IPAddress)

   docker inspect <container id 1 OR container name> | grep "IPAddress"
   
   OR
   
   docker inspect <container id OR container name> | findstr "IPAddress"

5- After creating the socat container, you can go back the docker configuration in jenkins and enter tcp://<socat-container-ip>:2375  

    ex: tcp://172.18.0.3:2375

6- "Test Connection" should success (shows some details about the version)
